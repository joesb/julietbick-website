Building on a career of supporting communication development, I have expanded my professional practice into coaching. This step reflected my growing interest in supporting personal development more broadly, helping people build confidence, navigate challenges, and unlock their own capacity for change.

In 2025 I completed my Postgraduate Certificate in Coaching at the University of Warwick, passing with distinction. I am currently an Associate member of the Association for Coaching, working towards full membership accreditation.

## What does coaching mean to me?

Coaching offers the space and time to stop and think.

At its heart coaching is a conversation between the coachee and the coach which leads to meaningful change.

As we trust the coaching process together, we can create space to explore, discover and learn.

## Trust

We will need to trust each other in our coaching

Read these 7 factors for cultivating trust from Brene Brown:

- **Boundaries:** You are willing to say no. You respect my boundaries.
- **Reliability:** You do what you say you’ll do.
- **Accountability:** You own your mistakes, apologise and make amends.
- **Vault:** You don’t share what’s not yours to share. Confidentiality.
- **Integrity:** You choose courage over comfort, what’s right over what’s easy.
- **Non-judgment:** We can each ask for what we need.
- **Generosity:** You assume the best of others’ intentions, words, actions

Do you agree with this list? Is there anything missing?

**BRAVING:** do you think it’s brave to trust someone?

What helps you trust someone?
