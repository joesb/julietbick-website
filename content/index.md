      **I am experienced in mentoring others with the development of children and young people’s communication.**
      
      We know that all children are different and need access to a variety of communication supports, from Early Years settings onwards.
      
      I am a specialist mentor for autistic undergraduates who require support at university.

I've been a practising Speech & Language Therapist since 1992. I work primarily with autistic children and young people.{.medium}

This includes working with their families, carers and school staff to support their communication with the autistic child or young person.

I believe in a strengths-based approach to our work together and focus on communication that stems from trust and connection.
