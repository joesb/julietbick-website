I've been a practising Speech & Language Therapist since 1992. I work primarily with autistic children and young people.{.medium .content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

This includes working with their families, carers and school staff to support their communication with the autistic child or young person.{.content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

I believe in a strengths-based approach to our work together and focus on communication that stems from trust and connection.{.content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

I have lived and worked in Birmingham for over 20 years. Communicating with others brings me joy, and I have been lucky to have had a career with communication at the centre.{.content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

Being myself with others, so that they can be who they are, is my passion.

## Where do I work?

I can work in your home or in another setting that works for us -for example a nursery or at school

## How do I work?

We will work together to give everyone confidence with how they are communicating with your child.

We will follow your child’s interests and join in with what they are doing.

Communication comes from relationship and connection.

We will have fun together!
