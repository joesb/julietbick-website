I have lived and worked in Birmingham for over 20 years. Communicating with others brings me joy, and I have been lucky to have had a career with communication at the centre.{.larger .bold .content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

Being myself with others, so that they can be who they are, is my passion.{.content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

Initially, I was employed by the NHS and then the Local Education Authority. In the last 10 years of my career, I have developed my own business, and I am currently working as a Coach, Speech and Language Therapist and Specialist Mentor.{.content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

## Where do I work?

I work in person and online, which we can discuss when you contact me.
