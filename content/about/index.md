I've been a practising Speech & Language Therapist since 1992. I work primarily with autistic children and young people.{.medium .content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

This includes working with their families, carers and school staff to support their communication with the autistic child or young person.{.content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

I believe in a strengths-based approach to our work together and focus on communication that stems from trust and connection.{.content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

I have lived and worked in Birmingham for over 20 years. Communicating with others brings me joy, and I have been lucky to have had a career with communication at the centre.{.content-canvas-item-main-start-main-right}

Being myself with others, so that they can be who they are, is my passion.
