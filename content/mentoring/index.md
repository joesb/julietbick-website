I am experienced in mentoring others with the development of children and young people’s communication.{.bold .larger}

You may want to consider my mentoring as part of:

- Parent support
- Ongoing support for the adults supporting a specific child’s communication development
- A specific mentoring contract with a wider range of staff
- Ongoing support for the SENDco of your setting developing universal support systems

Please [contact me](#contact-modal){.open-modal rel="modal:open" data-modal} if you would like to discuss the needs of your setting and we can work together to design the support that will have the greatest impact.

We know that all children are different and need access to a variety of communication supports, even if they do not have their own EHCP.{.bold .vlarge .headings-font .lineheight-1 .paragraph-narrow}
{.padding-block-lg .content-canvas-item-wide-left-more}
  {% endMarkdown %}
{% endColourBG %}

This starts in Early Years settings. I can offer one-off or ongoing support for a setting, tailored to the needs of your children and staff.

There are some very useful resources being developed for early years settings which can be found at [diversepathways.org](https://diversepathways.org/){rel=noopener target=_blank}.

I am also trained as a specialist mentor working with autistic undergraduates who require support while they study at university. University can be a challenging place and regular support with a trusted adult can support the student to enjoy this time.

The student may require support with participating with seminars and other group activities, ensuring they pace their work to prevent exhaustion and manage living alongside others away from home.
